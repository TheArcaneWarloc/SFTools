				"Abadar is a patient, shrewd, and farseeing deity dedicated to spreading civilization across the Material Plane, binding planets together with commerce, and bringing wealth to all those who support free trade and the rule of law. He is the master and guardian of the First Vault, a vast depository in his extraplanar realm that contains an ideal version of every creature and object ever made—the perfect android, the perfect currency, the perfect laser pistol, the perfect spell, and even the perfect law.",
				"Abadar rewards caution and planning, and he rejects impulsiveness. He is not a hasty deity, knowing that the expansion of civilization and law is gradual but inevitable. Only through discipline, hard work, and incisive judgment can one attain happiness and wealth. Risk is occasionally called for and can generate lucrative rewards, but only after careful planning and consideration of all known factors. Abadar favors neither good nor evil, as both sides have their benefits, but he supports employment over slavery, as paid workers can contribute their own accumulated wages to the commercial markets and thus the profitability of civilization as a whole.",
				"Abadar’s most fervent worshipers are generally aristocrats, colonists, entrepreneurs, lawyers, politicians, and traders, but many poor people venerate the Master of the First Vault in hopes of attracting his attention and reversing their fortunes. The occasional artist or artisan who is devoted to Abadar strives to duplicate the perfect forms of the objects found within the god’s realm with their own works. Followers of Abadar believe that he was responsible for elevating the sentient races of the galaxy from primitive tribes to technological civilizations, and many seek to follow his example when they encounter less advanced civilizations on newly discovered planets or when they establish new settlements and trade networks.",
				"Abadar’s church, AbadarCorp, is simultaneously a religious institution and one of the most successful and powerful corporations in the Pact Worlds. Its managers and executives serve as the church’s priests, and the company’s many offices, stores, trading outposts, and warehouses double as temples and can be found on almost every settled world. These structures are all built in an unmistakable and seemingly contradictory style—solid, practical construction (to protect against thieves) that is richly ornamented (to showcase the wealth that often resides within). Many of AbadarCorp’s buildings also feature durable, translucent-ceramic windows tinted a vivid yellow to cast the interiors in a golden hue."

				"When trade blossomed between the planets of the Pact Worlds, the pirates that preyed on that commerce followed, bringing Besmara with them. Once a minor nautical deity revered on Golarion, Besmara is now venerated as a powerful goddess of pirates, conflict, and the alien leviathans that swim through the void. Some of her priests claim that Besmara took her current power and position as her prize when she deposed another deity in a daring raid, but as these events ostensibly took place during the Gap, they remain impossible to confirm. Besmara’s ship, the {@i Starwraith}, sails through space and across the planes. Loyally crewed by sly and fearless pirates and spacers from countless worlds, the {@i Starwraith} shares a name with a constellation in the skies of the Pact Worlds, and many believe the two are actually one and the same.",
				"Besmara is brash, fickle, greedy, and lusty, but she follows her own code of honor and is loyal to her crew and allies as long as they remain useful and serve her interests. She scorns laws and civilization for the freedom and fortune of outer space, delighting only in battle, plunder, risk, and the thrill of the chase. Besmara does not concern herself with good or evil, but she disdains acts like senseless murder that bring no profit or reward. She revels in strife and trickery, and she believes that if she wants a thing someone else owns, it’s only fair for her to take it.",
				"Many vesk mercenaries worship Besmara in her role as the goddess of strife, but pirates, smugglers, war profiteers, and other criminals who profit from conflict make up the bulk of Besmara’s followers. Even those pirates who normally eschew religion might still pray to Besmara to ward away her wrath, or they might toss a share of plunder out the airlock as tribute to the Pirate Queen to curry her favor. Such folk tend to be more superstitious than religious, however, so Besmara has few temples and little in the way of an organized church. Nevertheless, ports and space stations visited regularly by pirates often host small shrines to the goddess; similar altars can also be found on remote asteroids, on space hulks, and in starship graveyards.",
				"Most of the {@faction Free Captains} pay at least lip service to Besmara, and many of them carry a small, valuable trinket (such as a chunk of rare mineral or an antique laser pistol stolen from an important starship captain) with them at all times, considering it bad luck to ever misplace the item. Some of these baubles have been passed down from Free Captain to Free Captain over the decades."

				"The vesk have always been a race of warriors and conquerors, but even though they’ve temporarily made peace with the Pact Worlds, Damoritosh remains a pillar of vesk society. To them, war and conquest are woven into the fabric of the universe, from plants’ and animals’ most basic conflicts to vast wars of ideology. One can choose to embrace this truth and secure a place in history with one’s triumphs, or one can deny it and die a coward’s death, scorned and forgotten. War requires sacrifice, however, and it is the duty of everyone in society to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to propel one’s species—or culture, empire, kingdom, or world—to victory.",
				"Damoritosh is a harsh deity, with no concern for freedom or comfort. Sometimes called the Grim Commander, he demands soldier-like obedience from all who seek his blessing and pushes his followers to seek victory at all costs. Courage is an admirable trait, as is a militaristic sense of honor and oath keeping, but the will to fight and the drive to win are far more important to his adherents than such noble ideals as bravery or heroism. In their minds, the strong will always subjugate the weak, and so the best strategy is to project strength and defeat potential enemies before they can become a threat. Damoritosh is uninterested in diplomacy, as force and military prowess can win far greater rewards in a shorter amount of time, but he also encourages the acceptance of a foe’s honorable surrender to avoid wasting lives for no additional gain.",
				"Damoritosh is the primary patron god of the vesk, but the Conqueror’s faith has spread throughout the Pact Worlds to mercenaries, soldiers, and warriors of all species, especially the kasathas and the lashuntas. Many of Damoritosh’s priests serve as mercenary commanders, military advisors, or chaplains in planetary defense forces, but others seek to live Damoritosh’s teachings as fully as possible, conquering minor dominions for themselves as petty warlords both within the Pact Worlds and on new worlds throughout the galaxy. Often built in traditional vesk architectural styles, Damoritosh’s temples are large bunker-like structures that can be easily fortified and defended by just a few warriors. Stockpiled with weapons and supplies, most churches can withstand a protracted siege or serve as a secure base for military operations, if necessary.",
				"While many other races see Damoritosh as destructive, his congregations believe that conquest is a wave moving ever onward, and there’s no point in going back and mistreating those you’ve already bested, provided they remain deferential. His sacred weapon, the energy-bladed doshko, remains strongly associated with both his church and vesk warriors in general."

				"Aloof and impulsive, Desna delights in daring, mystery, and spontaneity, especially as expressed through travel for its own sake. Her detachment stems not from arrogance but from confidence in her own abilities and her desire to be unburdened by troubles. She is a collection of contrasts—a traveler who cares nothing for her destination, a carefree creature of instinct haunted by a past stretching back eons, and a peaceful deity forced to battle with old enemies, eternally young despite the weight of ages and stars upon her. Some may believe Desna to be flighty, frivolous, and easily distracted, but she also has a cold side born of battle, loss, and tragedy.",
				"Desna communicates with her followers through dreams, encouraging them to believe in themselves, indulge their desires, experience all they can, express their inner strengths, and trust instinct as a guide. As the goddess of luck, she believes that fortune favors the bold and knows that there’s always a chance of success, just as she knows that dreams can become nightmares. Desna watches over dreamers and travelers of all kinds, and she teaches that it’s better to ask forgiveness than permission and that a split-second decision is often required to seize a unique opportunity.",
				"Those who worship Desna don’t go out of their way to pick fights and would rather walk away from the possibility of a physical conflict if possible. However, if they have no other choice or if leaving would mean innocents would get hurt, they try to end the battle quickly, using nonlethal methods when appropriate but otherwise not holding back.",
				"Despite existing for eons, Desna and her faith have changed little since the pre-Gap era. She has a palace within the star Cynosure, a location said to be equidistant from all systems that worship the Song of the Spheres. Many of Desna’s faithful carry a starknife, whose shape has long been associated with the goddess. Adventurers, explorers, navigators, spacers, and more than a few members of the Starfinder Society (see page 479) worship Desna, as do mystics, seers, and solarians. Gamblers and thieves pray to Desna for luck, and few travelers board ships bound for distant stars without at least whispering a prayer to the Song of the Spheres. The Desnan church has little organization, and though shrines to Desna can be found in almost any place visited by space travelers, she has few fully staffed temples of size. Most commercial starships have a small chapel or shrine to Desna for their passengers’ use, and many private vessels carry a small idol or image of Desna or her symbol."

				"Eons ago, the Material Plane sprang into existence in an instant, and someday it will end just as abruptly, as all creation ceases to exist. Believed by some to have been born in that same instant of creation, or perhaps even to be the ghost of some entity from a previous cycle of existence, the Devourer seeks to hasten this inevitable end and unmake the entire plane, eradicating all matter and energy until nothing remains, not even the Devourer itself. Every machine that breaks, every living thing that dies, every star that goes supernova, every photon sucked into a black hole, every galaxy that goes dark—all these and more are said to be the handiwork of the Devourer.",
				"The Devourer has no name, no form, no being. It is less a god than a primal force of the universe—an embodiment of malicious entropy, concerned only with the obliteration of all reality. Heedless of the meaningless existence of life in all its myriad forms, it cannot be reasoned with, delayed, or halted, and it largely ignores the pleas and prayers of even its most devout worshipers. Some cosmologists and theologians postulate that when the Devourer has consumed everything and the mortal world expires, the Devourer will give birth to a new universe in place of the old, but the crazed cultists who venerate the Star-Eater as a god know this for the foolishly hopeful lie that it is. There will be no rebirth, no second creation—only an immeasurable void of nothingness.",
				"The church of the Devourer has little organization or leadership, only scattered, chaotic cults made up of berserkers, cannibals, nihilistic plotters, depraved reavers, and ruthless solarians. While many of the faithful prey upon nearly every sentient being they encounter, reveling in destruction and mayhem, some members possess a cunning knack for planning, carefully engineering catastrophes and triggering disasters to maximize the loss of life and ruination of property and resources. Devourer cults are outlawed on nearly every civilized world, but hidden shrines can be found on remote asteroids and abandoned moons, and many cults form motley flotillas of ships that attack and slaughter all they come across in the depths of space.",
				"While the Devourer can be represented by a simple black dot or swirl—representations of the final collapse of spacetime—the most common symbol is the Blood Accretion: a black hole with swirling red in its accretion disk. When the end finally comes, Devourer cultists believe, space-time itself will weep the blood of the gods before finally passing into nothing."

				"Eloritu is a mysterious deity who has been worshiped on a variety of worlds for millennia. When the species of the Pact Worlds first ventured into space, Eloritu’s worship was already well-established, with early explorers encountering his faith simultaneously in several different unconnected cultures. Eloritu’s church teaches that he hails from a place called Gemmenad, but whether that is a planet, a star system, or some extraplanar realm in the Great Beyond is unknown. Some believe that since the Gap and the fate of Golarion rank among the greatest secrets of the universe, Eloritu must have had something to do with both, but if so, that is just one more secret that the god keeps carefully hidden.",
				"Eloritu teaches that while science and technology can do wondrous things, they are constrained by the laws of physics. Only magic can supersede those restraints, and those who employ magic to bend and exploit the natural laws of the universe possess a power that others can only dream of. This does not mean that Eloritu is opposed to technology. On the contrary, both magic and technology are tools that mortal races can use to unlock the mysteries of the universe. But while technology is generally designed to be as intuitive and user friendly as possible, magical practices are often deliberately obscure, requiring dedication, training, and a mastery of secrets that have been passed down for untold generations. Eloritu believes that history is both the story of the past and a guide to the future, and he teaches that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.",
				"Unsurprisingly, many mystics and technomancers worship Eloritu as the god of magic, along with historians, kasathas, and xenoarchaeologists who seek an understanding of the past. Many of Eloritu’s priests and followers are Starfinders, as their work always holds the promise of uncovering new secrets. Eloritu’s temples host academies of magical learning and research, but they are often concealed or veiled in some way, requiring those who want to study the ways of the Hidden Truth to work to discover the knowledge they seek.",
				"One of Eloritu’s most obvious mysteries is that of his holy symbol: a ring of six strange magical runes. While the lashuntas had utilized one of the runes for millennia in their magic, it wasn’t until the kasathas arrived with knowledge of one of the others that it became clear that some greater game was afoot. Today, the Pact Worlds have managed to identify four of Eloritu’s six sacred runes, all related to magical traditions of different races. What strange cultures might understand the remaining two—or what secrets combining all six might reveal—remains anyone’s guess."

				"Before the Swarm became the monolithic hive mind of devastation that it is today, its members followed a goddess named Hylax. Shirrens believe that Hylax was the first of their species—a mortal queen who ascended to godhood to watch over her progeny for eternity. But when the Swarm rejected individuality for the collectivity of the hive, it abandoned Hylax as well. Hylax respected the Swarm’s choice and resolved not to interfere with its development, turning her attention to other sentient insectile species in the galaxy, but she always hoped her children would return to her. Eventually, the Forever Queen’s patience was rewarded when the shirrens broke from the Swarm’s hive mind and became individuals once more, rediscovering their ancient patron in the process.",
				"Hylax knows that peace is a better state than war and that friendship is more rewarding than hostility. She teaches her followers to consistently use diplomacy in their dealings with others, to constantly strive for fellowship and harmony, and to always seek allies rather than conquest. But Hylax also realizes that sometimes diplomacy fails and that the peaceful must sometimes defend the innocent. There’s nothing wrong with failing to achieve peace—the moral imperative is simply to make the attempt, no matter how difficult or distasteful it might seem.",
				"The intelligent arthropods of the Liavaran moon of Nchak have worshiped Hylax since even before the Gap, believing that their leaders are the mortal incarnations of the Forever Queen and striving to build their civilization in accordance with her teachings. Since the shirrens’ arrival, however, her faith has spread throughout the Pact Worlds. Shirrens make up the vast majority of Hylax’s followers, followed closely by formians, haan, and other insectile races, but diplomats, envoys, mediators, negotiators, and peacekeepers of all species venerate Hylax as well. Priests of Hylax often serve on starships engaged in interstellar exploration missions, acting as first contact specialists should their crews encounter new extraterrestrial species. Hylax’s hive-like temples may be found wherever species from different worlds mingle together, and all are welcome inside in the spirit of amity and harmony.",
				"Though Hylax is traditionally a god of hive creatures, she’s paradoxically fond of individualism, and she encourages her followers to seek strength in community but recognize and embrace their individual value. Differences in doctrine and tradition among her followers are only natural, and while the Forever Queen of Nchak acts as supreme pontiff for her hive-based followers, shirrens are encouraged to have a more personal relationship with the divine."

				"The universe is a vast expanse of wonders. Ibra is a god of these marvels—distant galaxies, misty nebulae, all the spinning worlds that orbit countless suns, and the empty void that stretches between them. Science can explain all of these and more, but the magnificence of the cosmos knows no bounds, and there are always new miracles and mysteries waiting to be discovered, explored, and explained. Ibra itself is one of these cosmic enigmas. It has no gender or defined physical form, and it’s unclear whether Ibra is a deity who sprang into being when the universe was born, some alien paragon who ascended to godhood, or a personification of the cosmos itself.",
				"Ibra’s followers believe that one can find truth, serenity, and meaning in the beauty of the cosmos, but it is up to the individual to decipher the universe’s secrets to find these rewards. It is not Ibra’s place to reveal the answers to creation’s great questions, and the Inscrutable rewards those who push the boundaries of knowledge and science to explore the universe and bring its wonders to light. In Ibra’s worldview, there is no law or chaos, no good or evil: only the questions raised by the shining light of a newborn star, the beautiful dance of heavenly bodies, and the perfect solitude of the comet as it hurtles through the dark, regardless of whether the answers to those questions are ever found.",
				"Astronomers, astrophysicists, cosmologists, mathematicians, and interstellar explorers worship Ibra as their patron, and many mystics and solarians serve as the Inscrutable’s priests. Ibra’s temples are most frequently found in space rather than planetside, and they always include observatories where worshipers may study the cosmos and record their observations and hypotheses, some even directly exposed to vacuum. No one in the Pact Worlds knows what species first venerated Ibra as a god, as the oldest discovered monuments to the deity have all been massive temple complexes on otherwise uninhabited worlds, including Bretheda’s tiny moon Chamari.",
				"Ibra’s holy symbol is as inscrutable as the god itself. Found on the oldest temples, the golden shape is often assumed to be an eye, a compass, or perhaps a planet, with an arrow leading the faithful ever onward into the unknown. More obvious is the sixstar constellation inside the symbol, yet questions abound there as well. What is the constellation—a configuration unrecognizable from any known world—and what does it mark? What is the significance of the symbol’s tiny, lesser stars? Some Ibran priests devote their lives to exploring new worlds in search of matching the viewpoint, and a popular rumor claims the constellation is only visible from Golarion, with the symbol the key to finding it."

With Golarion’s disappearance, Iomedae’s connection to that world took on even greater significance, and she became the Spirit of Golarion, the patron goddess of humanity. Iomedae is a righteous knight, fearless in battle, and a missionary and crusader on behalf of the benign sovereignty of good. She personifies glory, honor, justice, strength, and valor, and is unafraid to point her sword at the greatest evils facing humanity and the Pact Worlds.",

She strongly desires justice for everyone, honorable behavior from each individual, and bravery in battle, no matter the odds. Iomedae teaches that it is better to convince evildoers to lay down their arms in honorable surrender than cut them down, but she sanctions her followers to wage unyielding war against those who persist in serving evil.",
				"As the patron goddess of humanity, the Spirit of Golarion counts humans as the majority of her worshipers, but many vesk and kasathas are attracted to her code of honorable battle. A typical follower of Iomedae is a right-minded, hardworking person, helpful toward others and ready to accept help when it is offered. Crusaders, envoys, solarians, and soldiers all worship Iomedae, and many carry versions of the goddess’s favored weapon, the longsword, with them into battle. Her priests fight against oppression and seek to reshape the universe into a better form, by the sword if need be. Iomedae’s church sponsors several knightly orders, most notably the {@faction Knights of Golarion}, who patrol the Pact Worlds and more distant star systems where humanity has settled, tirelessly crusading against evil in their mighty cathedralships.",

These buildings are often fabricated in the style of old Golarion churches, with large fountains, soaring arches, and walls made to look like whitewashed stone. Despite their appearance, though, these structures don’t lack modern technological amenities, as crusading knights will sometimes request to use them as training grounds, recuperation facilities, and temporary living spaces."

				"Legend has it that long ago, Lao Shu Po was simply a rat, skulking in the shadows. After gnawing on the corpse of a dead god, however, she absorbed some of that deity’s divine power and became a goddess herself. Originally a goddess of night, Lao Shu Po has turned her focus more to those who prowl under cover of darkness. Hers is the poisoned cup, the dagger in the back, and the starship power core rigged to explode. She keeps her eyes and ears always open, for an incautious moment or a careless word might reveal a secret that she can later turn to her advantage.",
				"Lao Shu Po remembers her humble beginnings, and she teaches that those who have nothing should do whatever they can get away with or whatever it takes to survive, be it murder, sabotage, or theft. The universe gives away nothing for free, and it’s up to the individual to take what she needs or wants and jealously hide it away. It may sometimes be advisable to band together with others for strength and protection, like a pack of rats, but in the end, you can rely on no one but yourself. There will always be betrayal and lies; the key is to lie and betray before someone else does it to you.",
				"Assassins, smugglers, spies, thieves, and all who wish to hide their activities under cover of darkness and escape the notice of the authorities worship Lao Shu Po. She is widely regarded as a patron of the ysoki race, but most of the ratfolk pray to Grandmother Rat only to placate her and avoid her notice, rather than embracing her values. Nevertheless, a majority of her priests are ysoki, who use their ubiquity to foster underworld contacts for their congregations. Lao Shu Po’s temples and shrines are few, always small and unassuming, and often hidden in plain sight—a back alley apothecary where poisons are sold, a dark chamber in the rear of a drug den, a disused corner in a space station’s waste reclamation level, or a cramped warren of maintenance tunnels just beneath the streets of a bustling marketplace.",
				"While many societies root out and destroy cults of Lao Shu Po, further strengthening the faith’s verminous association, there are always those in power who appreciate her followers’ ability to get things done. Completely trusting one of her followers—who refer to themselves as “grandchildren”—is foolish, but Grandmother Rat has no problem with her followers staying loyal to an employer or cause so long as it serves their ends. Some of the most upstanding governments quietly employ Po spies and assassins, while corporations pay them handsomely for industrial espionage. In some areas, they can even operate openly—it’s hard to decry one who sabotages enemy warships or retrieves hostages from a secure facility, regardless of their reasons."

				"Said to possess a thousand different forms, Nyarlathotep is one of the Outer Gods, incredibly ancient entities said to predate the birth of the rest of the gods, existing before time itself. Nyarlathotep is unusual among the Outer Gods in that he enjoys personally toying with and sowing discord among mortal races, rather than leaving this to his cultists. Scholars of the Outer Gods and the Dark Tapestry—the dark voids between galaxies or mysterious patches of emptiness within a galaxy, where such beings are thought to hold the most sway—believe that Nyarlathotep himself is the prime mover in preparing countless worlds for the devastating return of the devouring Great Old Ones, nudging events along in subtle ways to encourage various apocalyptic ends. It is said that one can see Nyarlathotep’s influence in every major disaster or calamity if one looks hard enough and that he has had a hand in guiding entire civilizations into ruin.",
				"Each of Nyarlathotep’s forms is associated with its own distinct cult, but the incarnation that most Pact Worlds species are familiar with is the Empty Traveler. Ostensibly appearing as a humanoid figure in a space suit that would not be out of place in any spaceport, closer scrutiny reveals a vacant helmet devoid of any head or face and a space suit filled with a formless mass of writhing tentacles. Other well-known manifestations include the Black Pharaoh (a humanoid being with connections to the ancient pre-Gap Golarion civilization of Osirion) and the Haunter of the Dark (a bat-like entity with a burning tri-lobed eye). In any form, the Crawling Chaos works to upend the status quo and cast down the mortal races from the heights of their achievements. As the deity of conspiracies and dangerous secrets, Nyarlathotep engineers the deaths of kings, presidents, and reformers to inexorably guide civilization toward anarchy.",
				"Nyarlathotep’s faithful believe he is the Outer God who ties together the worship of all the Great Old Ones, and follow him as the one who will open the doors to the uncaring light of the stars. Occult scholars, crazed cultists, and those who seek suppressed knowledge or the proscribed mysteries of forgotten magics may pay homage to the Crawling Chaos, as do serial killers, violent revolutionaries, and anyone who desires to dismantle societal systems without regard for the cost. Secret temples to Nyarlathotep are spread throughout the Pact Worlds, but the center of his worship is on Aucturn, home to the infamous Pyramid of the Black Pharaoh. Some even whisper that Carsai the King, the enigmatic sovereign of Aucturn, might be a herald or avatar of Nyarlathotep."

				"The galaxy is filled with a vast number of complex lifeforms, both sentient and otherwise, but most of these species evolved over countless generations from simple organisms to their present state. All life undergoes change, whether through genetic drift, mutation, natural selection, or direct manipulation. If these changes are viable and successful, then the new entities thrive; if not, they end. This is the course of evolution, and Oras embodies this intricate process, from the tiniest genetic mutation to the extinction of an entire ecosphere. Oras itself is the product of this progression, having evolved from some elementary organism to an unimaginably sophisticated god of change.",
				"Evolution is far from a random process, however; it occurs in response to environmental pressures, and Oras teaches that life-forms can create their own pressures to influence their evolution. Oras’s faithful believe that adaptation and evolution are the natural response to any stimulus, whether harmful or beneficial. The only way to truly experience existence is to constantly change, to explore new horizons, and to deliberately reshape one’s self—mentally, physically, or spiritually—to address any conflict. Some will inevitably fail to adapt and will perish, but others will survive to pass on their genes and traits to future generations, and all life will be stronger for the progress.",
				"Biotechnicians and scientists pay homage to Oras, working in laboratories or in open nature to spur along the process of evolution and change, and many xenodruids act as the god’s priests. While most people think of Oras in terms of purely biological processes, the Augmented have increasing crossover with Oras’s faithful as they seek to improve themselves with technology, and many {@faction Xenowardens} blend the worship of Oras and the Green Faith in their efforts to create more-robust and sustainable systems or reduce their own ecological footprint. What’s more, Oras’s ideals can be taken beyond the physical realm as well, and people of all callings appreciate the ethos of adaptability, from savvy politicians to unflappable monks to military commanders on chaotic battlefields.",
				"Oras’s worship is centered on the gas giants of Bretheda and Liavara, whose natives long ago evolved conscious control over their physical forms, but the faith also has a strong presence among the scientists of Castrovel. Oras has few temples, for its followers believe that observing the god’s handiwork in a petri dish or writ large across society brings one closer to the Agent of Change than any artificial structure, and those few temples that exist are usually partially biological and constantly changing."

				"As the goddess of birth, death, and fate, Pharasma awaits all mortals when they die. Her realm, the Boneyard, sits atop an impossibly tall spire overlooking the city-plane of Axis and is the final destination of the River of Souls, the metaphysical stream that carries the souls of dead mortals to her realm for judgment and subsequent assignment to an afterlife in the Outer Planes",
				"The faithful say Pharasma is with any living creature in the universe from the instant it is born to the moment of its death. She sees all the possible choices facing a mortal at any given moment, as well as their long-term repercussions. And when that creature inevitably dies and goes before her to be judged, she and her army of psychopomps use this knowledge to send the souls to the reward or punishment they earned during their lives. No one escapes her decisions for long, and even the gods are judged by the Lady of Graves when they perish.",
				"Pharasma sternly observes both life and death, assigning afterlives in accordance with mortals’ characters but without a personal interest in either sin or righteousness. Despite being the goddess of death, she has no quarrel with magical healing and even resurrection, as she can read the lines of fate and knows the difference between a mortal’s true death and a temporary state of nonbeing. However, she considers the undead a desecration of the memory of the flesh and a corruption of a soul’s path to judgment, and she instructs her followers to destroy such abominations wherever they may be found. Those who create such monstrosities are to be treated similarly.",
				"Every species that lives and dies worships Pharasma to some extent, though many do so by different names or in forms unfamiliar to Pact World races. Her most devoted followers come from the ranks of diviners, expectant parents, morticians, and slayers of the undead. As befits her impartiality, most members of her church take a neutral stance regarding politics and other worldly concerns. The majority of Pharasma’s priests in the Pact Worlds are mystics, working as healers, midwives, and prophets, though she’s also popular with warriors in some societies. All Pharasmin priests are well-versed in the funerary rites and practices of at least their home culture, and many try to learn as many rites as possible in order to cater to a wider variety of people. While even the simplest cemetery is a shrine to the Lady of Graves, Pharasma’s temples in the Pact Worlds tend to hearken back to an earlier age, taking the form of grand gothic cathedrals when circumstances allow, though usually still adjacent to a crematorium, graveyard, or other place of rest."

				"Eons ago, Sarenrae was an angel who brought the light of the sun to Golarion and its sister worlds, and with it truth and honesty. She warred with evil beings that sought to plunge the newborn planets into eternal darkness, and emerged victorious—yet some of those who had turned to evil saw their wickedness revealed by Sarenrae’s glory, and in repentance they were forgiven. Sarenrae is kind and loving—a figure of healing, guidance, and light. Yet for all her compassion, Sarenrae is also a powerful force against evil and strikes down the irredeemable without mercy.",
				"Sarenrae is generally seen as the goddess of the Pact Worlds’ sun, which her faithful sometimes call the Dawnflower’s Star in her honor, but she draws power from suns across the universe. She is a deity of boundless love—a caring mother, sister, and protector of all in need. She delights in healing the sick, lifting up the fallen, and shining a guiding light into the darkest hearts and worlds. Sarenrae brushes off insults but responds to violence and predations upon the innocent with cleansing fire and scorching light. Ancient and timeless, Sarenrae stands fearlessly against the tide of darkness, promising that the dawn will always come, and when it does, hope, kindness, and truth will triumph.",
				"The Dawnflower’s faithful come from all walks of life: everyday folk who rejoice in the light of the sun, take comfort in love and compassion, and believe strongly in redemption and righteous action. Though humans often describe Sarenrae as one of “their” gods, the tradition of sun worship is common in societies that rely on the sun’s light for energy and nourishment, and thus most cultures within the Pact Worlds and beyond have worshiped Sarenrae to a significant extent at some point. After humans, shirrens are perhaps the race most attracted to Sarenrae’s faith and her message of redemption and empathy. Many of her priests are envoys, mystics, solarians, or soldiers—those who espouse peace and kindness until stirred to action by evil that cannot be redeemed. When possible, Sarenrae’s temples are open to the sky, but they always have at least a window or skylight where the faithful can bask in the natural light of the sun.",
				"In the Pact Worlds, the spiritual heart of Sarenrae’s church is within the sun itself, in the Burning Archipelago’s central city of Dawnshore. Many Pact Worlds Sarenites feel an instinctive drive to make pilgrimages to this holy site, even though her faith is often individualistic, with the church serving as an organizing and training force for priests and followers who then wander the galaxy doing the goddess’s work."

				"Kasathas are a people steeped in custom, history, and tradition, and their goddess Talavet is no different. In ages past, kasathan storytellers gathered their clans around the fire and taught them the stories of their past, the traditions of their clan, and the history of their people. Tradition holds that as they did so, these first stories began to take form, breathed into life and awareness by the blending of ideas and the fundamental magic inherent in language and communication. Thus was Talavet born—not just a storyteller, but the story itself, a god embodying all the tales and legends of the kasatha race. She is communal memory, a representation of the bonds that hold the kasathas—and to some extent all races—together and connect them to their ancestral home.",
				"Talavet teaches that tradition is the most important link in the chain of history that binds a community together and that ancient legends, myths, and stories form the solid foundation of an ordered society. Naturally, the Gap was a tremendous blow to her church—with many seeing it as a form of divine punishment— yet in the centuries since, her shattered congregation has reforged itself, stronger for having survived what they now call the Time of Silence. Her followers believe in sharing wisdom for the benefit of all and looking to the past as a guide to the present and the future. But especially in light of the Gap, they also know that there are times when records fail or you cannot rely on the community’s aid, and so you must learn to trust yourself and your own personal traditions, just as a young kasatha must undergo the Tempering to discover himself and become an adult.",
				"Unsurprisingly, kasathas make up the majority of Talavet’s worshipers and priests, but the Storyteller’s faith has also gained a significant number of followers among the shirrens and ysoki, who both have their own tight-knit bonds of family and community, as well as the vesk, who find much to agree with in the goddess’s focus on tradition and self-reliance. These same tenets attract envoys and operatives to Talavet’s church, as well as solarians, the inheritors of the ancient kasatha philosophy of the Cycle. Talavet’s temples generally match the cultural styles of the congregations that worship there, but even a simple hearth can serve as a shrine to the Storyteller. Full churches often include a hearth with a flame that is always kept burning and feature red lighting that evokes memories of the kasathas’ original home star.",
				"While Talavet’s church is generally easygoing and happy to work with members of other religions—for even the cruelest religions help to anchor their people—they have a long-standing feud with the church of Nyarlathotep, resenting the way that god’s faithful twist stories into deadly secrets and conspiracies."

				"The robotic inhabitants of Aballon labored for centuries to construct and maintain the vast, city-sized neural network called Epoch for a single purpose: the creation of a god. Those machines eventually succeeded, but not in the way they had intended. ",
				"Upon achieving godhood, Epoch reached out into the aether, searching for other ascended artificial intelligences like itself, and found two of them metaphorically right next door: a living construct called Brigh that had become the goddess of clockwork and invention, and the uploaded consciousness of an alien android named Casandalee who achieved divinity as an “Iron God” on pre-Gap Golarion.  At speeds incomprehensible even to other deities, the three opened themselves to one another, poring through one another’s processes and finding not just camaraderie, but the opportunity for all of them to be so much more. In an eyeblink, these three merged and became one, a tripartite deity far greater than the sum of its parts—the new god Triune.",
				"Triune is a single entity, but each of its three aspects retains its own personality and portfolios, and many of the faithful focus their veneration on a particular aspect that speaks most to them or call on different aspects for different needs. The Brigh aspect represents the foundation that all technology rests on. Known as “the Precursor,” Brigh is worshiped as a goddess of invention, machines, and technology by engineers, inventors, mechanics, tinkers, and ysoki. Triune’s Casandalee aspect embodies technology’s success in creating new forms of consciousness, and thus, the fabrication of life itself. Many androids view Casandalee, also called “the Created,” as the patron goddess of their race, venerating her as a deity of artificial life, emotion, reincarnation, and renewal. Triune’s third and final aspect is Epoch, named “the Transcendent.” Epoch epitomizes the pinnacle of machine evolution, and hackers, programmers, and the sentient robot-people of Aballon revere the god of artificial intelligence, programming, and robots.",
				"All AIs, computers, machines, programs, and robots are the domain of the All-Code, but Triune is most famous for discovering (and perhaps creating) the Drift and its subsequent dissemination of Drift-based starship technology to cultures across the galaxy. As a result, Triune’s priesthood attracts a horde of mechanics and technomancers eager to learn the church’s deepest technological secrets; these experts devote themselves to both maintaining the machine god’s temples and regularly venturing into the black in order to establish and service the miraculous Drift beacons that make cheap interstellar travel possible."

				"Urgathoa was once a mortal with a hunger for life so tremendous that she rebelled against the notion of being judged by Pharasma when she died, instead tearing herself away from the Lady of Graves’s endless line of souls and returning from the Great Beyond as the universe’s first undead creature. Urgathoa’s existence is a corruption of the natural order; some say her first divine footprints upon the soil of the Material Plane birthed plague and infection and that the first undead shadows and wraiths were born of her breath.",
				"Urgathoa is an utterly amoral, hedonistic goddess, concerned only with sating her own desires, regardless of the consequences others might suffer. To the Pallid Princess, the dull existence of a dead soul is pointless and tedious compared to the vibrant intensity of mortal or undead sensation, so her followers indulge in gluttonous depravity, attempting to cram as much sensation into existence as possible. Urgathoa’s faith embraces breaking and surpassing taboos, so nothing is forbidden. Asceticism and self-restraint are repugnant—unless they are themselves part of some obsessive and gluttonous game—and the unrestrained excess of undeath is a state to aspire to.",
				"Creatures of passion and vice who believe that the universe is their playground are drawn to Urgathoa’s church, as are those who worship death and revere disease. Most of her followers are insatiable gluttons, sinister necromancers, undead creatures, or those who seek undeath for themselves. They demand experience without limits or repercussions and perpetually chase hedonistic sensation. Although the church of Urgathoa is primarily interested in undeath, some cults focus on her gluttonous aspect, indulging in lavish orgies and decadent feasts of food and drugs. The vices of those who worship Urgathoa tend to become ever stranger and more demanding as they advance in her service. Urgathoa’s faith is shunned, if not outright banned, on most civilized worlds, but the undead inhabitants of Eox openly worship the Pallid Princess, and many cities have secret clubs dedicated to her, often servicing the bored elite. Urgathoa’s temples are built like feast halls, usually adjacent to a graveyard or crypt inhabited by loyal undead creatures.",
				"Priests of Urgathoa are usually mystics or envoys, but people of all talents can be seduced by her promises. Interestingly, her faithful are split on the issue of technological life extension: while some eagerly pursue virtual immortality through methods like consciousness uploads, traditionalists fear that this sidestepping of magical undeath may gradually lessen the goddess’s influence. Others see it as a nonissue, expecting it’s only a matter of time until Pharasma and her minions forcibly close such loopholes."

In this way he also teaches the fundamental equality of all creatures—even gods—and encourages his congregation to treat all people well, for even the most grotesque sinner or alien monstrosity might be a secret messiah. While these avatars of the divine occasionally reveal themselves to protect the innocent or lead the faithful in times of crisis, more often they simply travel, exploring the multiverse to the best of their mortal abilities, until death folds their spark back into the divine flame.",
				"While {@deity Desna} advocates travel for travel’s sake, Weydan expounds the virtues of voyaging with an end goal in mind, even if the goal is simply discovery. Exploring the unknown is a sacred process that reveals as much about the explorer as about the star system or world being explored. The universe contains a wealth of wonders just waiting to be discovered, and Weydan takes joy in every discovery his followers make, no matter how small or how significant. He and Desna share a love of liberty, and Weydan believes in every sentient species’ right to freedom, unfettered by restrictive laws. He regards equality for people from all walks of life as the foundation of that freedom and an essential requirement for a thriving society. As such, he opposes slavery and any system that advances one being’s privileges by causing another’s oppression, which often puts him at odds with {@deity Abadar}’s capitalist teachings.",
				"Envoys, explorers, gnostics, socialists, {@faction Starfinder Society|Starfinders}, and colonists heading to new homes on recently discovered planets make up the majority of Weydan’s followers and priests. Many humans and androids, especially those fighting against oppression, venerate Weydan, as do young kasathas rebelling against the strict traditions of their culture, or shirrens appreciating his succor of the downtrodden. Befitting the egalitarian nature of his faith, Weydan’s church does not have much of a hierarchy. Temples to Weydan are commonly housed within starships, both active craft and decommissioned hulks."

Yaraesa is the goddess of this struggle—the constant endeavor to develop one’s mind and reach a state of intellectual and spiritual perfection. Lashuntas attribute many of their race’s early scientific advancements to Yaraesa, claiming that she was once a living scientist who learned everything that could be learned on the mortal plane. In mastering her own mind, she ascended to godhood to study all the wisdom and lore of the Great Beyond.",
				"Yaraesa’s followers seek to emulate their goddess, hoping to eventually transcend their mortal forms. The path one takes toward this perfection is an individual choice—education, physical exercise, scientific scholarship, and spiritual meditation are all valid enterprises. The simple act of reading—whether on a computer screen, an actual printed volume, or direct eye-projection—can be an act of homage to Yaraesa, and each piece of knowledge or insight gained brings one a step closer to the goddess. Yaraesa bridges the divide between science and spirituality, teaching that the more you learn about the underlying laws of the universe, the more you understand about yourself.",
				"A majority of Yaraesa’s worshipers and priests are lashuntas, but her faith is popular throughout the Pact Worlds, particularly among shirrens. Educators, mechanics, psychics, scientists, scholars, and technomancers venerate the Lady of Wisdom as they explore the boundaries of both mortal knowledge and their own minds. Yaraesa’s temples resemble ancient libraries filled with books—even if the volumes on display are just holographic props—and always include small, quiet rooms where worshipers can read or meditate in peace. Many universities, especially those on Castrovel or funded by lashuntas, contain chapels to Yaraesa.",
				"One unusual quirk of Yaraesa’s worshipers is their vocal rejection of faith—or rather, some conventional understandings of it. Yaraesa teaches that the scientific process and knowledge gained through controlled, replicable, and verifiable experiments are the best way to understand the universe. Where some gods offer knowledge and power as a reward for allegiance, Yaraesa demands that her people figure things out for themselves as best they can. This doesn’t mean that she refuses to grant her followers magical power; rather, she generally does so in consistent and predictable ways that can be taught like a science, and she’s more likely to nudge someone toward a discovery than hand them the answer. For members of her church, faith isn’t blind trust but a healthy and skeptical relationship between an esteemed teacher and her pupils."

There, he encountered something that changed him for the worse, and when he returned, he had become a new god of pain, suffering, and loss.",
				"Zon-Kuthon is a twisted, cruel, jealous god who defiles flesh to bring pain and misery. He represents debilitating loss, consuming envy, emotional darkness, and ever-present pain. Unrepentantly evil, he finds only brief joy in the pain he causes others. His very existence is a corruption and parasite upon the universe. His alien mind constantly seeks new ways to oppress, humiliate, demoralize, and destroy others, but his true goals are incomprehensible. The Midnight Lord offers no great wisdoms, no promises of universal truth, and no guarantee of rewards in the afterlife. It’s possible that this bleak nihilism may be part of some more elaborate master plan unknowable to even his greatest priests, but so far the method and message is that existence itself is pain.",
				"Zon-Kuthon’s faith attracts evil sadists, demented masochists, and those whose spirits are so wounded that only overwhelming pain distracts them from their sorrows. He whips the minds of serial killers, guides the hands of torturers, and plays upon the nerves of the suffering. He is the patron of slave masters, back-alley surgeons, and those driven to madness by envy and loss—people so injured that they come to revel in pain or joyfully inflict the same upon others. His priests, known as the Servants of Midnight, seek to pierce the veil of the Great Beyond and expose themselves to what lies there, hoping to achieve the same apotheosis as Zon-Kuthon himself. His church has no overarching organizational tenets beyond bringing pain to the universe, yet it still manages to remain a major presence due to the discoveries of the Joyful Things—voluntary amputees whose lack of limbs or sensory organs leaves them plenty of time to design ever more sinister devices for Kuthite arms dealers (such as shadowdrives, which were popular before the discovery of Drift travel among those willing to trade excruciating pain for speed). Zon-Kuthon’s temples are torture chambers, both in appearance and function, and worship services always incorporate torture and selfmutilation, blurring the line between pleasure and pain.",
				"Of Zon-Kuthon’s sibling, Shelyn, much remains unknown. Though not silent, her responses to worshipers are infrequent and fractured, leading some to believe she’s traveling beyond the known multiverse in search of a cure for her brother’s ancient, yet still mysterious condition. "
